### cue_book - a project designed for editing and creating with 0 cue sheet for audiobooks.
*Only CUE for images is supported.*

Planned functionality:
- Adding a chapter to an existing ones (when the information about the chapter was skipped)
- Inserting a chapter to an existing ones (when a chapter is physically added to a book)
- Auto-generation of chapters of equal length (imitation of pseudo-chapters for books that don't have real chapters)
- Creating a new CUE and filling it in (performer/title/chapters)
- Perhaps over time, after the implementation of the main functionality, cue generation based on timestamps from Audition / etc 

**At the moment, the codebase is very raw, in the process of designing and refactoring.**
